# Spark

This repository contains information about the big data tool "Spark". 

I used Spark to build a machine learning example using a random forest algorithm to predict the spending amount of 233599 customers, using a predictive model trained on 550068 observations. 

Along with the example, you can find my presentation witch contains information about Spark and instructions on how to install it as standalone cluster manager on a OSX machine.
